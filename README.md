## :wave: Hi there, I'm Cara

[![github-badge]][github-url] [![twitter-badge]][twitter-url] [![linkedin-badge]][linkedin-url]

I'm passionate about Open Source technology; I believe it fosters innovation and brings tremendous value to businesses large and small.

Currently, I lead Product-led Growth at [Aiven](https://aiven.io/), working on making leading Open Source data technologies accessible to all. Previously, I was a Product Manager at [Snowplow](https://snowplowanalytics.com/), the first Open Source Behavioural Data Platform, helping companies take control of their data strategy. 

ðŸŒ± I am thinking about different business models and Go-to-Market strategies around open source software. 

ðŸ’¬ Talk to me about all things Open Source technology, Product-led Growth and Developer-focused Marketing!
