## :wave: Hi there, I'm Cara

[![github-badge]][github-url] [![twitter-badge]][twitter-url] [![linkedin-badge]][linkedin-url]

I am passionate about enabling companies to do more with data. Over the last 8 years, I have worked in various Product and GTM roles for Open Source data companies, including [Quix](https://quix.io/), [Aiven](https://aiven.io/) and [Snowplow](https://snowplowanalytics.com/).

ðŸŒ± I am thinking about how companies could better catalog their data to make it more discoverable, and therefore utimately more valuable to the business.

ðŸ’¬ Talk to me about all things Data, Open Source technology and Product-led Growth!
